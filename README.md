# TheOutlet's Plugins

External plugins to use in the OpenOSRS client. 
- 
These utility functions have been imported from Illumine's, and are based off his `i-utils`.
These plugins do not meet Jagex's plugin standards and should be use with caution.

Potential Additions:
- 
- Replace with MeteorLite API... maybe.
